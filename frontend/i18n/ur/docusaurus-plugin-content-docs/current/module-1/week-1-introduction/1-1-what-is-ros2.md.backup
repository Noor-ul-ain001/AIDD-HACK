# 1.1: What is ROS 2?

## Overview

This submodule provides a detailed exploration of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) - the next-generation framework for developing robot software applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this submodule, you will:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2
- Know how ROS 2 differs from traditional operating systems
- Recognize the use cases and applications of ROS 2
- Be familiar with the ROS 2 ecosystem

## What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 is the second generation of the Robot Operating System, an open-source framework for developing robot applications. It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. ROS 2 improves upon the original ROS with better security, real-time support, and improved build system among other enhancements.

### Key Characteristics

- **Middleware-based**: Uses DDS (Data Distribution Service) for communication between processes
- **Distributed**: Supports multi-robot systems and distributed computation
- **Modular**: Components can be developed and deployed independently
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Linux, Windows, macOS, and real-time operating systems

### ROS 2 vs. Traditional OS

ROS 2 is not a real-time operating system but rather a collection of tools and libraries that work across multiple machines. While traditional OSs manage hardware resources and provide system services, ROS 2 provides:

- Communication between robotic components
- Hardware abstraction and device driver interfaces
- Tools for debugging, testing, and visualizing robot behavior
- A package management system for sharing robotic software components

## ROS 2 Ecosystem

The ROS 2 ecosystem includes various components and tools that work together to facilitate robot development:

1. **Core Libraries**: rclcpp, rclpy (client libraries for C++ and Python)
2. **Build System**: Colcon (build and package management)
3. **Communication Tools**: ros2 command-line interface
4. **Visualization Tools**: RViz, rqt tools
5. **Simulation**: Gazebo integration

## Applications of ROS 2

ROS 2 is used across various domains in robotics:

- **Autonomous vehicles**: Navigation and perception systems
- **Industrial robotics**: Manufacturing and automation
- **Service robotics**: Humanoid robots, companion robots
- **Research**: Academic and commercial research platforms
- **Space exploration**: NASA robotics projects

## Summary

This submodule introduced ROS 2 as a middleware framework that simplifies the development of complex robotic applications. The next submodule will explore the ROS 2 architecture in more detail.
