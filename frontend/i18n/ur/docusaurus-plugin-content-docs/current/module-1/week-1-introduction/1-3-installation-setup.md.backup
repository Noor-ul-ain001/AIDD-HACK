# 1.3: ROS 2 Installation and Development Environment Setup

## Overview

This submodule provides comprehensive instructions for installing ROS 2 and setting up your development environment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this submodule, you will:
- Install ROS 2 on your preferred operating system
- Configure your development environment
- Set up the ROS 2 workspace
- Run your first ROS 2 example

## Choosing Your ROS 2 Distribution

ROS 2 has multiple distributions released approximately every year. The current LTS (Long Term Support) distribution is Humble Hawksbill (2022), which is recommended for production systems. Other distributions include:

- **Humble Hawksbill**: LTS, supports Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 11, Windows, macOS
- **Iron Irwini**: Regular release, supports Ubuntu 22.04
- **Rolling Ridley**: Development branch (not for production)

## Installation Prerequisites

### System Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| OS | Ubuntu 22.04/20.04, Windows 10+, macOS 11+ | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS |
| CPU | 4 cores | 8+ cores |
| RAM | 8 GB | 16+ GB |
| Storage | 50 GB free space | 100+ GB |

### Ubuntu Installation

1. **Set locale**:
```bash
locale  # check for C.UTF-8
sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

2. **Add ROS 2 apt repository**:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl gnupg lsb-release
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(source /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
```

3. **Install ROS 2 packages**:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
sudo apt install ros-dev-tools
```

4. **Initialize rosdep**:
```bash
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

### Windows Installation

1. **Install Chocolatey**:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

2. **Install Python and Visual Studio**:
```powershell
choco install python visualstudio2019buildtools visualstudio2019-workload-vctools
```

3. **Download and install ROS 2**:
Download the Windows binary release from the ROS 2 website and extract to `C:\dev\ros2_humble`

## Environment Setup

### Source ROS 2
```bash
# Ubuntu
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

# Windows
call "C:\dev\ros2_humble\local_setup.bat"
```

### Create a Workspace
```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

## Testing Your Installation

1. **Open two terminals**

2. **In the first terminal**:
```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
```

3. **In the second terminal**:
```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
```

You should see messages being published by the talker and received by the listener.

## Development Tools Setup

### VS Code Configuration
Create `.vscode/settings.json` in your workspace:
```json
{
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/opt/ros/humble/bin/python3",
    "cmake.cmakePath": "/usr/bin/cmake",
    "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux": "bash"
}
```

### Common ROS 2 Commands
- `ros2 run <package_name> <executable_name>`: Run a node
- `ros2 topic list`: List all topics
- `ros2 node list`: List all nodes
- `ros2 service list`: List all services

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Command not found**: Ensure you've sourced your ROS 2 installation
- **Permission errors**: Check your workspace permissions
- **Python issues**: Verify your Python version and packages

## Summary

This submodule covered the installation of ROS 2 and setup of your development environment. You should now have a working ROS 2 installation and be able to run basic examples. The next submodule will cover practical exercises to reinforce your understanding.
