# Week 2: Gazebo Basics

## Overview

This week introduces the fundamentals of Gazebo, a powerful robotics simulator that allows you to test and validate your robotic systems in a virtual environment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will:
- Understand the core concepts of Gazebo simulation
- Set up and configure Gazebo for ROS 2 integration
- Create and manipulate simulation environments
- Implement basic robot models in Gazebo

## What is Gazebo?

Gazebo is a 3D dynamic simulator with the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments. It provides the tools and environment to create, test, and validate robotic systems before deploying them on real robots.

### Key Features

- **Physics Simulation**: Realistic simulation of rigid body dynamics
- **Sensors**: Support for various types of sensors (cameras, lidar, IMU, etc.)
- **Plugins**: Extensive plugin system for custom functionality
- **ROS Integration**: Native integration with ROS/ROS 2

## Installing Gazebo

For detailed installation instructions, refer to the [official Gazebo installation guide](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=install).

### Requirements for Gazebo with ROS 2

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| OS | Ubuntu 22.04/20.04 | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS |
| GPU | OpenGL 2.1 compatible | Dedicated GPU with CUDA support |
| RAM | 8 GB | 16+ GB |
| Storage | 5 GB | 10+ GB |

## Getting Started with Gazebo

### Launching Gazebo

```bash
# Basic launch
gazebo

# Launch with empty world
gazebo --verbose worlds/empty.world

# Launch with ROS 2 integration
ros2 launch gazebo_ros gazebo.launch.py
```

### Basic Gazebo Environment

When Gazebo starts, you'll see:
- A 3D visualization window showing the simulated world
- Control panel with simulation tools
- Model database for adding objects to the simulation
- Light sources and environment settings

## Gazebo Worlds and Models

### Creating Worlds

Gazebo worlds are defined using SDF (Simulation Description Format) files:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<sdf version="1.7">
  <world name="default">
    <include>
      <uri>model://ground_plane</uri>
    </include>
    <include>
      <uri>model://sun</uri>
    </include>
  </world>
</sdf>
```

### Adding Models

Gazebo includes a database of common robot models and objects. You can add models programmatically or through the GUI:

```bash
# List available models
gz model --list
```

## ROS 2 Integration

### Gazebo Plugins for ROS 2

Gazebo provides plugins that enable communication with ROS 2:

1. **libgazebo_ros_diff_drive.so**: Differential drive controller
2. **libgazebo_ros_joint_state_publisher.so**: Joint state publisher
3. **libgazebo_ros_camera.so**: Camera sensor interface

### Example Integration

```xml
<!-- In your robot's URDF/XACRO -->
<gazebo>
  <plugin name="diff_drive" filename="libgazebo_ros_diff_drive.so">
    <ros>
      <namespace>/my_robot</namespace>
    </ros>
    <left_joint>left_wheel_joint</left_joint>
    <right_joint>right_wheel_joint</right_joint>
    <wheel_separation>0.3</wheel_separation>
    <wheel_diameter>0.15</wheel_diameter>
  </plugin>
</gazebo>
```

## Practical Exercise

This week's exercise will guide you through setting up a simple differential drive robot in Gazebo and controlling it via ROS 2 commands.

1. Launch Gazebo with ROS 2 integration
2. Spawn a differential drive robot model
3. Control the robot using ROS 2 topics
4. Implement a simple navigation task

## Summary

This week introduced Gazebo, a powerful simulation environment for robotics. You've learned how to set up Gazebo with ROS 2 integration and how to create basic simulation scenarios. Next week, we'll look at more advanced simulation concepts and integration techniques.
