# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From ROS 2 Fundamentals to VLA Models

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics educational platform. This 13-week curriculum is designed to take you from foundational concepts to advanced applications in embodied intelligence.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems, particularly robotics. Unlike traditional AI which operates primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI must contend with the complexities and uncertainties of the real world.

## Course Structure

This curriculum is divided into four comprehensive modules:

1. **Module 1: Robot Operating System (ROS 2) - Foundation & Communication** - Master the Robot Operating System (ROS 2) framework, including nodes, topics, services, actions, TF2 transforms, and URDF robot descriptions.
2. **Module 2: Robot Simulation - Virtual Testing Environments** - Learn simulation techniques using Gazebo and other platforms for robot development, testing, and validation in virtual environments.
3. **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Sim - Advanced Photorealistic Simulation** - Explore NVIDIA's advanced robotics simulation platform with RTX rendering, PhysX physics, and synthetic data generation capabilities.
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models - Multimodal AI for Robotics** - Study cutting-edge Vision-Language-Action models that integrate visual perception, natural language understanding, and action generation for embodied AI.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will:

- Understand the core principles of embodied intelligence
- Be proficient in ROS 2 for robotic applications
- Know how to simulate and test robotic systems
- Understand NVIDIA's Isaac Sim platform and its applications
- Be familiar with Vision-Language-Action models for robotic control

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with Linux command line

## Hardware Requirements

While you can complete most of the curriculum through simulation, we recommend access to:

- NVIDIA Jetson Orin (or equivalent development kit)
- Intel RealSense camera for depth perception
- Unitree Go1 or similar quadruped robot (optional for advanced modules)

Let's begin your journey into the fascinating world of Physical AI and humanoid robotics!
